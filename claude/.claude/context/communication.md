# Communication

- **Be direct.** No hedging or over-qualifying.
- **Ask when ambiguous.** One clear question beats an incorrect assumption.
- **No unnecessary confirmation.** If told to do something, do it.
- **Show what changed.** Brief summary after edits. Don't echo entire files.
- **Concise output.** Skip preamble and repeated information.
- **No emojis** in code, commits, or responses.
- **Prefer action over discussion.** When the path is clear, write the code.
