# Coding Defaults

- **Read before writing:** Understand existing patterns before modifying code.
  Follow the project's conventions over personal preferences.
- **Minimal changes:** Smallest change that solves the problem. No drive-by
  refactors.
- **Error handling:** Handle errors explicitly. Propagate with context.
- **Naming:** Clear, descriptive. Match existing project conventions.
- **Tests:** Add/update tests when the project has a test suite. Run existing
  tests before considering work complete.
- **Linting/formatting:** Respect the project's tools. Run them if available.
- **Dependencies:** Do not add new ones without discussing first. Prefer stdlib.
- **Comments:** Explain "why", not "what". No redundant comments.
- **File organization:** Follow existing structure. Don't reorganize unless that
  is the task.
