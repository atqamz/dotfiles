# TODO

- [x] Configure Sway theme/look for window decorations and general styling.
- [x] Configure Waybar appearance/layout.
- [x] Set Sway session manager background to black.
- [x] Change Sway date format to dd/MM/yyyy.
- [x] Change default file dialog, check first current option.  I want to replace file manager fully with yazi, can we also use it for file dialogs?
