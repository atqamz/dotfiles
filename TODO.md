# TODO

- [x] configure sway theme/look for window decorations and general styling
- [x] configure waybar appearance/layout
- [x] change Sway date format to dd/MM/yyyy
- [ ] change default file dialog, check first current option. I want to replace file manager fully with yazi, can we also use it for file dialogs?
- [ ] populate dnf-fresh
- [ ] figure out why SourceGit tends to be slow, maybe we're not handle XWayland correctly
      (we can try to find how Fedora Sway Spins config and list of packages required)
- [ ] find out why network system tray not showed (prev on Fedora Sway Spins it showed)
